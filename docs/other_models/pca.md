# Principal Component Analysis

>ðŸ’¡ #story _Principal component analysis_ (PCA) was proposed by Karl Pearson and was presumably the first paper on unsupervised learning.

The idea behind PCA is that variables often vary together, so PCA tends to reduce the number of variables by creating a smaller number of predictors (principal components) which model the most of the original probability

New axes are linear combinations of previous and all orthogonal to each other.
